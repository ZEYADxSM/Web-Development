	<h1>About me </h1>
    <h2>Through the worksheets, I have learned a great deal about web development. I began with Practical 1, which required me to create a basic web page in HTML. This exercise taught me the fundamentals of HTML, such as semantic tags and adding links and images. Although it was challenging to design the page, I am pleased with the final result.</h2>
<h2>Moving on to Practical 2, I worked on marking up a CV in HTML5. This practical required me to use more advanced HTML tags to structure the content, such as the section and article tags. I found this exercise more challenging than the first, but it helped me to develop my skills further. </h2>
<h2>In Practical 3, I worked on using CSS with HTML5 to style my CV. This exercise taught me how to control the layout, typography, and colors of my page using CSS properties. I found this practical to be the most enjoyable and satisfying, as I was able to see the immediate impact of my changes. </h2>
<h2>Preparing for Practical 4, I reviewed an HTML file that contained JavaScript code. Practical 4 involved using JavaScript and HTML forms, which was a bit more challenging than the previous exercises. However, it taught me how to create dynamic web forms using JavaScript. </h2>
<h2>Finally, Practical 5 covered responsive design, which is crucial for ensuring that websites are accessible across different devices. This practical introduced me to the concept of media queries, which allow you to create styles that are specific to different screen sizes. </h2>
<h2>Overall, I am pleased with the skills I have developed through the worksheets. Although some exercises were more challenging than others, I learned a lot from each one. I hope to continue practicing and refining my skills in web development in the future. </h2>
